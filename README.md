# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6).

## Overview

I chose this challenge to practice my skills in the field of frontend developer.

## My Process

- I created this project using Next Js, typescript, tailwind css, and firebase.
- In this project I got a lot of experience about the backend. Starting from how I create structures from my data, even make the runtime on the backend as efficient as possible. I still have a lot to learn about firebase, that's why I'm going to use firebase in some of my future projects.
- If you are interested in firebase. [Visit the following link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).
